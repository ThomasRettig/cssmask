               <span>by Jonathan Hoefler</span>
               <p>I suspect I’m not alone in my current appetite for reading: right now I’m craving things that are written with clarity, wit, honesty, and heart, and I very much need to hear from good-natured people of extraordinary ability who love what they do. Below are some of the books I’ve most enjoyed reading of late, three connected only tangentially with typography because their subjects are words, and two that are more expressly about design. All five share a sincerity, an attention to detail, and a sense of humor that has kept me smiling for weeks. I hope you’ll enjoy them as much as I have.</p>

               <h2 id="word-by-word"><span class="copy" title="Copy anchor link" data-clipboard-text="https://cssmask.vercel.app/#word-by-word">🔗</span>Word by Word</h2>

               <p>Of the many books about words and dictionaries that I seem to have read, I can’t remember enjoying any quite as much as <em>Word by Word,</em> Kory Stamper’s account of life as a lexicographer. Stamper and her colleagues at Merriam-Webster write dictionaries, which surely bests my own weirdo profession for its ability to stump the uninitiated. <em>You do what, now?</em></p>

               <p>More than a mere tour of the scholarly work of gathering citations and writing entries, <em>Word by Word</em> is an exploration of the responsibilities of a working lexicographer, recounted from Stamper’s unique perspective and told with her delicious wit. There’s the business of engaging with the public: sure, politely declining your proposal for this kickass word that should totally be in the dictionary, but also answering the journalist who has found a moment of abominable racism casually lurking in a definition, and would like a statement fifteen minutes before airtime. There’s the ongoing project of revising the dictionary, from updating outmoded definitions (“marriage”) and confronting prejudice (“nude” colored stockings), to <span>wtf</span>ing all manner of baffling weirdness, such as the children’s dictionary that merrily illustrates the word “up” with the sample phrase “blow <em>up</em> the bridge.” And then there’s the field research, collecting and reading everything, not just newspapers and novels, but advertisements, transcripts, pamphlets, liner notes, and the occasional unopened cardboard cylinder of oatmeal that someone brought in because it offered a promising citation for “steel cut.”</p>

               <p>Stamper rejoices in the nuance of English and welcomes its expanding perimeter, steadfastly refusing to judge, and instead telling the truth about how language is used. She’s quick to deflate pompous fallacies, reminding us that Shakespeare employed double negatives and Jane Austen used “ain’t,” and that every standard for Good Grammar boils down to someone’s arbitrary ideas about style. “We think of English as a fortress to be defended,” she writes, “but a better analogy is to think of English as a child. We love and nurture it into being, and once it gains gross motor skills, it starts going exactly where we don’t want it to go: it heads right for the goddamned electrical sockets.”</p>

               <h2 id="dreyers-english"><span class="copy" title="Copy anchor link" data-clipboard-text="https://cssmask.vercel.app/#dreyers-english">🔗</span>Dreyer’s English</h2>

               <p>If you are a compulsive oversharer and spoiler of the books you read — <em>haha! listen to this, this part’s great:</em> — and already too familiar with your loved ones’ scowls as they burrow deeper into their pillows, don their headphones, or simply take off for the goddamned living room, you might approach <em>Dreyer’s English</em> with caution. It is a style guide for writers, and while it’s demonstrably useful as a handbook, it’s also acidly funny, and a bonafide page-turner. Dreyer is joyously eclectic but unshowy in his anecdotage, that rarest of artists who likes to color with all the crayons in the box, and still manages to create something splendid. It’s difficult to resist quoting my favorite passages in full, but equally hard to limit myself to sharing only a few sublime moments, such as the interlude about thorny punctuation entitled <em>The Possessivization of Donald Trump, Jr.: A Grand Guignol in One Act,</em> the entries for T. S. Eliot and Alanis Morissette, and the section discussing the words <em>come/cum,</em> footnotes and all. Footnotes most of all.</p>

               <p>Benjamin Dreyer is the executive managing editor and copy chief at Random House, and copy chiefs are a curious literary fulcrum: they may assist writers, but they serve readers, by working to make writing more clear. It’s a job that’s part lifeguard, part rabbi, part authority, and part best friend, requiring the ability to understand one’s authors so well that one can help them be better at being themselves. This may involve pencilling out a redundant word that was written without thinking (<em>all-time</em> record, <em>hollow</em> tube), or observing that a postcard from the fifties would have been addressed not “Boston, MA 02128” but rather “Boston 28, Mass.” It may involve asking whether you noticed, or are at all concerned, that the climactic scene in your book is shared by four characters whose names all begin with the letter <em>M.</em> Copy chiefs also know that <em>Finnegan’s Wake</em> doesn’t actually have that apostrophe, that Chewbacca was not a Wookie but a Wookiee, and that neither <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> nor <em>The Diary of Anne Frank</em> is the correct title of the book you’re thinking of.</p>

               <p><em>Dreyer’s English</em> is organized as a reference book but served like a feast, each course distinctive and exciting. Its author takes an unabashedly personal approach to style, candidly copping to his choices with a refreshing insouciance. (Each moment of subjectivity or contradiction is disclosed with an undercurrent of <em>yup, that’s how I like to do it, whatcha gonna do.)</em> I enjoyed the book first as a cover-to-cover read, later as an indispensable desk reference, and most recently as an intermittent literary refuge for these verbally tortured times.</p>

               <h2 id="word-freak"><span class="copy" title="Copy anchor link" data-clipboard-text="https://cssmask.vercel.app/#word-freak">🔗</span>Word Freak</h2>

               <p>In the introduction to <em>Word Freak,</em> a man who plays professional Scrabble witheringly characterizes author Stefan Fatsis as “a good living room player.” This comes at a point where Fatsis is routinely finishing games with scores north of 400 — already better than I do today, and I always fancied myself a pretty good player — and this is our introduction to a realm of competitive play that transcends mere vocabularistic prowess. In one memorable exchange, a player opens a game with the word <span>entasis,</span> scoring a fifty point bonus for using all seven of his tiles; his opponent calmly counters by placing <span>realise</span> atop it, scoring not only for his own seven-letter word, but for the seven <em>two-letter words</em> it produces. This has yet to happen in my living room.</p>

               <p>A longtime sports journalist, Fatsis has a natural gift for capturing the drama of the contest and the heroism of its contestants. We are introduced to one top-ranked player, so singularly devoted to the game that he’s never moved out of his parents’ house, where he tirelessly plays online for fourteen hours a day; we then meet another player, a stage performer who casually tried the game at a friend’s suggestion, and discovered a preternatural ability that landed him at the very top of the field as well. (Needless to say, a throughline of the book is how much the first guy <em>hates</em> the second guy, and their moments of conflict and cooperation are recounted with wicked delight.) These are players for whom words like <span>haftarot</span> and <span>oxtering</span> are common, as are scores in the high seven hundreds. <em>Word Freak</em> is not only a look into this peculiar alphabetical precinct, but a joyful chronicle of Fatsis’ own development as an accomplished player, a wordplay enthusiast, and a lover of words.</p>

               <h2 id="house-industries-lettering-manual"><span class="copy" title="Copy anchor link" data-clipboard-text="https://cssmask.vercel.app/#house-industries-lettering-manual">🔗</span>House Industries Lettering Manual</h2>

               <p>I wonder what the elevator pitch was for Ken Barber’s new book. Because Ken and I have known each other for twenty-some years, its contents make perfect sense to me: it integrates hands-on instruction, case studies of his adept work at House Industries, photographs of the author in costumes and wigs, meditations on the practice of typography, and references to both Swedish and Norwegian black metal <em>(pp. 15, 194.)</em> It is embossed with a crocodile print, and has a foreword by Jimmy Kimmel. To someone who knows Ken and his work, this is all of a piece, a signature blend of serious artistry and not taking himself too seriously, the result of a career spent observing, teaching, laughing, and above all, drawing. Whether or not he slipped all this into the brief may never be known, but how lucky we are that he did.</p>

               <p>Ken and his colleagues at House are famous for a sincere eclecticism that embraces Hot Wheels and Giambattista Bodoni with equal affection <em>(pp. 162, 140)</em>, which makes the <em>House Industries Lettering Manual</em> doubly noteworthy: first for its willingness to draw upon so many different traditions, and second for its admirable restraint. For a book that straddles three genres — it is part manual, part monograph, and part essay — Ken has included the best of what each has to offer, and trimmed absolutely all of the fat. The case studies, concise rather than exhaustive, are chosen with care, which only serves to make the occasional forays into tracing paper iterations that much more satisfying. As a manual, the book focuses on genuine instruction, and resists the temptation to pad its pages with genre examples. (So many books about lettering are a few pages of tips, followed by a Bataan Death March of stock alphabets in styles from blackletter to sans serif — a practice that was arguably useful in the days before the internet, but is unforgivably pointless today.) Smartly, Ken has instead created focussed illustrations of typographic phenomena, offering practical advice about the shaping of letters and words, and employing a useful and intuitive nomenclature that goes far beyond <em>x-heights</em> and <em>ascenders.</em> The book’s differentiation between <em>component, area,</em> and <em>perimeter</em> drawings was new to me, as was its definition of <em>rolling</em> as opposed to <em>arcing</em> lettering, a byproduct of Ken’s collaboration with all manner of lettering artists. In a sidebar about energetic letterforms, I found his distinction between <em>vertical, proportional,</em> and <em>rotational</em> bounce to be useful handles for something I’ve viscerally felt, but never thought to dissect. Ken’s well-illustrated observations are easily understood and quickly absorbed, seeming completely second nature once you’ve taken them in, always the hallmark of the very best teaching.</p>

               <p>As a designer, it’s nearly impossible to surrender myself to the fantasy of a period drama, because I’m forever anticipating the moment when a ham-fisted prop will shatter the illusion. It’s not the anachronisms that trouble me — I try to distance myself from the pedantic dingdongs who complain about a 1958 magazine using a 1962 typeface — and moreover I’ve always felt that one of the strengths of a new typeface is its ability to pass for vintage when it’s <a href="https://discover.typography.com/theme/wanderlust/" target="_top">artfully arranged</a> in <a href="https://discover.typography.com/theme/eyes-only/" target="_top">period style</a>. Rather, it’s the <em>category</em> errors that wreck movies, those moments when the entire mode of communication is wrong: broadsheet newspapers with screamer headlines, Cold War identity papers that are typeset instead of typewritten, signboards outside Dickensian shopfronts that use lowercase letters, engraved invitations that are set in a <em>font</em> of any kind — the list goes on. Even the non-specialists in the audience can feel these mistakes, the way we all know when a hemline or a fender feels out of place. But somehow the cars and costumes get plenty of attention, and the lettering is so often neglected, unless someone like Annie Atkins is attached to the project.</p>

               <p>Atkins creates the on-screen graphic art that contributes so powerfully to the atmosphere of a film. Her period work is pitch perfect, recreating Cold War New York for <em>Bridge of Spies,</em> and Victorian London for <em>Penny Dreadful,</em> and the mythical Kingdom of Zubrowka in Wes Anderson’s beloved fantasia <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel.</em> As much as the actors’ performances, it is Atkins’ props that sell the story, her pageant of banknotes and pastry boxes that so convincingly renders the bittersweet enchantment of a crumbling mitteleuropa.</p>

               <p>Atkins’ delight in printed ephemera is alloyed with an incisive perception, and her work carries the conviction of an artist who has learned not merely to admire but to see. So many of her props are informed by an understanding of cultural context — nineteenth century invoices pierced by a needle instead of a punch, a background sign displaying the historically correct price for a haircut — and are equally shaped by the fascinating requirements of filmmaking. The parts of her book that deal with production are among my favorites, exposing an entire dimension of graphic art that’s designed to go unobserved. It’s not difficult to imagine that a set dressing, designed to be placed deep in an unfocussed background, will have different requirements than the “hero props” intended to be handled by actors and captured in close-up. But I’d never considered that paper is fragile, even without perspiration and hot lights, or that film shoots are given to multiple takes, or that many props are designed to be altered or destroyed by the action. I’ll be thinking of Atkins next time I see a character tear up a telegram, and I’ll wonder not only how many copies had to be fabricated for that single shot, but if it was her who managed to imprint each with an identical splash of coffee. —JH</p>
